# Computer-Science-Project-2021
Hello Marker/Teacher/Interested person

To Find An Executable, go to GUI for Project, Bin, Release

Many of the files in this project are just for GUI navigation and don't contain that much unique content, The Most important files (in decending order of importance) are:

Physics_Engine(Controls how the electronics simulator behaves and many of the methods to manipulate the circuit)

BaseCircuitGUI(Contains the code that displays the circuit and manipulates the graphical elements, is integrated into Physics_Engine)


CustomCircuitBuilder(Is the most complex inherited class (inherits from BaseCircuitGUI) and has many functions the user can change the behaviour of their custom circuit)


Learning Modules classes e.g. Power, OhmsLaw,ComponentsInSeries,ComponentsInParrallel and SlidePotentiometer (These Classes are there to satisfy my end user by restricting the functionality of the program and focusing on only some parts of the functionality )
